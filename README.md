# DSA210-Term-Project

I am a student from SabancÄ± University, **Ada Dila Akbulut**, and this is my DSA210 term project. 
The aim of this project is to analyze the interaction between menstrual phases and physical activity data from Apple Health.

## **Motivation**
Menstrual phases can significantly influence physical activity and overall well-being. Understanding how different phases correlate with physical activity patterns may help in better managing health and fitness goals. By studying the data I acquired from a period tracker app and Apple Health, I hope to:
- Understand the relationship between menstrual phases (e.g., follicular, luteal, ovulation, and menstruation) and my step counts, flights climbed, and walking/running distances.
- Identify trends in physical activity levels across different menstrual phases.
- Gain actionable insights into how physical activity varies with menstrual cycles and vice versa.

## **Project Goal**
The goal of this project is to uncover patterns in physical activity across menstrual phases by correlating data from a period tracker app and Apple Health. This project aims to provide insights into how menstrual phases influence physical activity levels and may suggest personalized recommendations for optimizing activity during different phases.

## **Data Source**
To protect privacy, raw data will not be shared in the repository. Instead, all analysis scripts and processed, anonymized data will be provided. A `.gitignore` file will be used to ensure sensitive or unnecessary files are excluded.

### **1. Period Tracker App Data**
Exported data includes:
- **Phase Information**: Menstrual, follicular, luteal, and ovulation phases.
- **Period Dates**:  Start and end dates of each menstrual cycle.

### **2. Apple Health Data**
Collected data includes:
- **Step Counts**: Daily step counts recorded by Apple Health.
- **Flights Climbed**: Number of flights climbed daily.
- **Walking/Running Distance**: Daily distance covered by walking or running.

## **Data Analysis**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned and structured datasets from the period tracker app and Apple Health.
- Merged datasets by date to align menstrual phases with physical activity metrics.
  
### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed distributions of step counts, flights climbed, and walking/running distances across menstrual phases.
- Visualized trends in physical activity metrics during different phases.
  
### **3. Correlation Analysis**
- Examined relationships between menstrual phases and physical activity metrics.
- Investigated if certain phases align with increased or decreased physical activity levels.

### **4. Visualization**
   - Visualizations to represent trends and correlations.
   - Histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, violin plots may be used.

## **Findings**
This section will be completed after the analysis is conducted.

## **Limitations and Future Work**
This section will be completed after the analysis is conducted. However, the expected limitations are:
- Limited to personal data, which may not generalize to larger populations.
- Period tracker data is restricted to phases and period dates, and Apple Health data is limited to step counts, flights climbed, and walking/running distances.
- The frequency and accuracy of data entries in Apple Health and the period tracker app may vary day to day.
