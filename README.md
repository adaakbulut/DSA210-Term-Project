# DSA210-Term-Project

I am a student from SabancÄ± University, **Ada Dila Akbulut**, and this is my DSA210 term project. 
The aim of this project is to analyze the interaction between menstrual phases and physical activity data from Apple Health.

These two hypotheses will be tested:
- **[First hypothesis](#1-physical-activity-in-menstruation-phase--other-phases)**: Physical activity is lower during the Menstruation phase compared to other phases.
- **[Second hypothesis](#2-physical-activity-in-follicular-phase--other-phases)**: Physical activity is higher during the Follicular phase compared to other phases.

## **Motivation**
Menstrual phases can significantly influence physical activity and overall well-being. Understanding how different phases correlate with physical activity patterns may help in better managing health and fitness goals. By studying the data I acquired from a period tracker app and Apple Health, I hope to:
- Understand the relationship between menstrual phases (e.g., follicular, luteal, ovulation, and menstruation) and my step counts, flights climbed, and walking/running distances.
- Identify trends in physical activity levels across different menstrual phases.
- Gain actionable insights into how physical activity varies with menstrual cycles and vice versa.

---

## **Project Goal**
The goal of this project is to uncover patterns in physical activity across menstrual phases by correlating data from a period tracker app and Apple Health. This project aims to provide insights into how menstrual phases influence physical activity levels and may suggest personalized recommendations for optimizing activity during different phases.

## **Data Sources and Preprocessing**
To protect privacy, raw data will not be shared in the repository. Instead, all analysis scripts and processed, anonymized data will be provided. A `.gitignore` file will be used to ensure sensitive or unnecessary files are excluded.

The preprocessing process of data is further explained in the following: [*Data Process*](.data_process.ipynb)

### **1. Period Tracker App Data**
Exported data includes:
- **Phase Information**: Dates of menstrual, follicular, luteal, and ovulation phases.
- **Period Dates**:  Start and end dates of each menstrual cycle.

For the data I requested from Clue, the period tracker app, I have requested to export data from the app and received it in .json format. Then, I converted the information in the files into four different .csv files: 
1. [Period dates](data/all_dates_with_period_flags.csv) explaining whether that day contains a period flag or not
2. The start and end dates of Follicular, Luteal, Menstruation and Ovulation phases, [*phase date ranges*](data/phase_date_ranges.csv)

### **2. Apple Health Data**
Collected data includes:
- **Step Counts**: Daily step counts recorded by Apple Health.
- **Flights Climbed**: Number of flights climbed daily.
- **Walking/Running Distance**: Daily distance covered by walking or running.

For the data I requested from Apple Health, I have requested to export data from the app and received it in .xml format. Then, I converted the information in the files into two different .csv files:
1. [Step count by date](data/stepcount_data.csv) 
2. [Flights climbed by date](data/flightsclimbed_data.csv) 
3. [Walking/Running distance by date](data/distancewalkingrunning_data.csv) 
4. [Combined information of step count, flights climbed and walking/running distance on given day](data/apple_health_combined_data.csv)

## **Data Analysis**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
This part has been explained further in [Data Sources and Preprocessing](#data-sources-and-preprocessing) part. What is acquired in this part is,
- Cleaned and structured datasets from the period tracker app and Apple Health.
- Merged datasets by date to align menstrual phases with physical activity metrics.
  
### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed distributions of step counts, flights climbed, and walking/running distances across menstrual phases.
- Visualized trends in physical activity metrics during different phases.
  
### **3. Correlation Analysis**
- Examined relationships between menstrual phases and physical activity metrics.
- Investigated if certain phases align with increased or decreased physical activity levels.

### **4. Visualization**
- Visualizations to represent trends and correlations.
- Histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, scatter plots are used.
- Here is some of the visualized data examples in the Findings section; however, it is highly recommended to check the following: [Data Visualization](.data_visualization.ipynb)

### Correlation Analysis

#### **1. Average Step Count by Phase**
- This bar chart displays the average step count for each menstrual phase, highlighting variations in physical activity levels throughout the cycle. The x-axis represents the phases (Menstruation, Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal), and the y-axis shows the average step count. The data reveals that the Menstruation phase records the lowest average step count, while the Follicular phase has the highest, potentially indicating increased energy levels post-menstruation. This analysis can inform further exploration of how physical activity correlates with different phases of the menstrual cycle.
- ***Trends***: Step counts showed variations across menstrual phases. The Menstruation phase recorded the lowest and the Follicular phase recorded the highest average step count, suggesting increased activity levels post-menstruation.

#### **2. Average Flights Climbed by Phase**
- This bar chart illustrates the average number of flights climbed during each menstrual phase. The x-axis represents the phases, while the y-axis shows the average flights climbed. The Follicular phase demonstrates consistently higher values compared to other phases, with a slight decline observed during Ovulation. Moderate levels are recorded during the Luteal phase. These trends may reflect how physical activity levels, particularly stair climbing, vary in relation to hormonal changes across the cycle.
- ***Trends***: Flights climbed were consistently higher during the Follicular phase compared to the other phases. The Ovulation phase showed a slight decline, with moderate levels observed during the Luteal phase.

## **Machine Learning**

- **Regression:** Predicting Step Count
- *Objective:* The goal of this analysis was to predict step counts based on menstrual phases, flights climbed, and walking/running distance using a Random Forest Regression model.
- Results Overview:
  - *RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)*: 320.95, indicating the average deviation of predicted values from actual values in terms of step counts.
   - *MAE (Mean Absolute Error)*: 219.14, which reflects the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
  - *Interpretation:* These metrics demonstrate that the regression model performs reasonably well, with predictions closely aligning with actual step counts.


- **Scatter Plot:** Actual vs. Predicted Step Count
  - The points cluster closely along the diagonal line, indicating a strong agreement between predictions and actual data.
  - Outliers represent data points where the modelâs predictions deviated significantly from the true values.
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce39f82-5840-4b7a-8899-0ff20f1af115)


- **Bar Chart:** Average Actual and Predicted Step Count by Phase
  - Both actual and predicted values show consistency across phases, suggesting the model's robustness in capturing trends across menstrual phases.
  - Minor deviations between actual and predicted values highlight areas for potential model improvement.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7ab7af2-f21e-42d3-9caa-b8c9d55abb5e)


- **Confusion Matrix for Binned Step Counts:**
  - Step counts were categorized into bins (e.g., 0-2000, 2000-4000, etc.) to evaluate the classification accuracy of the regression predictions.
  - The matrix compares the actual binned step counts to the predicted bins.
    - High values along the diagonal indicate that the model frequently predicts the correct step count range.
    - Misclassifications (off-diagonal values) suggest areas where the model could be optimized, particularly for higher step count ranges.

## **Limitations and Future Work**
### **Limitations**
- The analysis is based on personal data, limiting its generalizability to larger populations.
- Period tracker data is restricted to phase information and period dates, while Apple Health data is limited to step counts, flights climbed, and walking/running distances.
- Data accuracy depends on the frequency and precision of entries in Apple Health and the period tracker app.
- External factors such as weather, mood, or daily activities that could influence physical activity are not accounted for.

### **Future Work**
- Extend the analysis to a broader dataset from diverse individuals to generalize findings.
- Incorporate additional metrics like heart rate variability, sleep patterns, or calorie expenditure for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Explore machine learning techniques to predict physical activity levels based on menstrual phases.
- Collaborate with researchers to validate findings and contribute to the growing body of menstrual health studies.
