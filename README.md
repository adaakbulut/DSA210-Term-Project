# DSA210-Term-Project

I am a student from SabancÄ± University, **Ada Dila Akbulut**, and this is my DSA210 term project. 
The aim of this project is to analyze the interaction between my Instagram usage habits and step count data from Apple Health.

## **Motivation**
Social media usage and physical activity have significant impacts on emotional and physical well-being. Emotional changes may influence social media habits and physical activity levels. By studying the data I acquired from Instagram and Apple Health, I hope to:
- Understand the relationship between my Instagram activity patterns (screen time, interactions, etc.) and my step counts.
- Identify trends in step counts and Instagram usage habits.
- Gain actionable insights into how social media habits and physical activity levels interact.

## **Project Goal**
The goal of this project is to uncover how Instagram usage habits correlate with step counts recorded in Apple Health. By analyzing these interactions, I aim to generate actionable insights and potentially provide recommendations for healthier social media usage and physical activity patterns.

## **Data Source**
To protect privacy, raw data will not be shared in the repository. Instead, all analysis scripts and processed, anonymized data will be provided. A `.gitignore` file will be used to ensure sensitive or unnecessary files are excluded.



### **1. Instagram Exported Data **
Exported data includes:
- **Phase Information**: Menstrual, follicular, luteal, and ovulation phases.
- **Mood Tags**: Emotional states (e.g., happy, anxious, energized).
- **Symptom Data**: Physical or emotional symptoms associated with each phase.

### **2. Spotify API**
Collected data includes:
- **Screen Time**: Daily and hourly Instagram usage data.
- **Activity Logs**: Number of posts liked, commented on, or saved.
- **Interaction Times**: Time intervals of highest and lowest Instagram usage.

## **Data Analysis**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Exported and cleaned datasets from Instagram and Apple Health.
- Extracted features such as total screen time, interaction frequency, step counts, and Instagram activity trends.
  
### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed data distributions and visualized trends in Instagram activity and step counts.
- Identified correlations between Instagram usage patterns and Apple Health step counts.

### **3. Correlation Analysis**
- Examined relationships between Instagram features (e.g., screen time, interaction frequency) and Apple Health step counts.
- Determined if certain Instagram usage habits align with increased or decreased physical activity.
- Investigated the combined impact of Instagram usage and physical activity patterns on well-being.

### **4. Visualization**
   - Visualizations to represent trends and correlations.
   - Histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, violin plots may be used.

## **Findings**
This section will be completed after the analysis is conducted.

## **Limitations and Future Work**
This section will be completed after the analysis is conducted. However, the expected limitations are:
- Limited to personal data, which may not generalize to larger populations.
- Limited features exported by Instagram and Apple Health, other factors that may influence well-being and activity patterns are not considered.
- The frequency of data entries to Apple Health may differ from day to day.
