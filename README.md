# DSA210-Term-Project

I am a student from Sabancı University, Ada Dila Akbulut, and this is my DSA210 term project. 
The aim of this project is to analyze the interaction between my phases' patterns recorded in my FLO period tracker app and my music listening habits from Spotify.

## **Motivation**
Music has a significant impact on emotions, and emotional changes may be tied to biological rhythms. By studying the data I acquired from FLO and Spotify, I hope to:
- Understand the relationship between my music preferences (genre, tempo, energy, sound, etc.) and my monthly phases.
- Identify trends that could help in creating personalized playlists to support emotional well-being during different phases.
- Gain actionable insights into how monthly phases influences music preference.

## **Data Source**

### **1. FLO Period Tracker App**
Exported data includes:
- **Phase Information**: Menstrual, follicular, luteal, and ovulation phases.
- **Mood Tags**: Emotional states (e.g., happy, anxious, energized).
- **Symptom Data**: Physical or emotional symptoms associated with each phase.

### **2. Spotify API**
Collected data includes:
- **Listening History**: Songs, timestamps, listening frequency and sound.
- **Track Attributes**: Tempo, energy, valence, and danceability.
- **Genres and Artists**: Categorization of songs by genre and artist metadata.

## **Data Analysis**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Exported and cleaned datasets from FLO and Spotify.
- Aligned timestamps and extracted features like listening time, genre distribution, and mood phases.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize trends in mood and music preferences.
- Identified correlations between Spotify attributes and FLO moods.

### **3. Correlation Analysis**
- Examine relationships between monthly phases and genres or song attributes.
- Determine if certain phases align with specific music preferences.

### **4. Visualization**
   - Visualizations to represent trends and correlations.

## **Findings**
This section will be completed after the analysis is conducted.

## **Limitations and Future Work**
